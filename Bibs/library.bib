@article{Reynolds2002,
abstract = {We provide the first review of phylogenetic transitions in parental care and live bearing for a wide variety of vertebrates. This includes new analyses of both numbers of transitions and transition probabilities. These reveal numerous transitions by shorebirds and anurans toward uniparental care by either sex. Whereas most or all of the shorebird transitions were from biparental care, nearly all of the anuran transitions have been from no care, reflecting the prevalence of each form of care in basal lineages in each group. Teleost (bony) fishes are similar to anurans in displaying numerous transitions toward uniparental contributions by each sex. Whereas cichlid fishes have often evolved from biparental care to female care, other teleosts have usually switched from no care to male care. Taxa that have evolved exclusive male care without courtship-role reversal are characterized by male territoriality and low costs of care per brood. Males may therefore benefit from care through female preference of parental ability in these species. Primates show a high frequency of transitions from female care to biparental care, reflecting the prevalence of female care in basal lineages. In the numerous taxa that display live bearing by females, including teleosts, elasmobranchs, squamate reptiles and invertebrates, we find that live bearing has always evolved from a lack of care. Although the transition counts and probabilities will undoubtedly be refined as phylogenetic information and methodologies improve, the overall biases in these taxa should help to place adaptive hypotheses for the evolution of care into a stronger setting for understanding directions of change.},

abstract = {Abstract Inold,spruce-dominated forests of central Finland, Eurasian treecreepers Certhiafamiliaris divide their territories spatially during the breeding season. Females forage primarily on the upper parts of the tree trunks, while males us ethe lower parts of the tree trunks. In this study were moved males from eight territories in the early nestling period to see if themate's absence would change the foraging patterns of there sident female. Widowed females foraged at lower heights, thus behaving more like paired males. These females also spent less time on each tree and on each foraging bout than did paired females. We conclude that male removal facilitated the change in a female'sforaging niche and foraging time at the trees. Females may reoptimize their foraging sites election owing to the absence of dominant males and a consequent need to increase their parentalcare. Behavioral plasticity maybe the mechanism of niche partitioning between the sexes in this species.},

consacrent plus de temps que les miles a l'incubation et a l'klevage,

Chez les trois espbces, miles et 

femelles ont manifest6 tout autant de comportements agonistiques.
Miles et femelles chaussaient les 

mCmes types de proies, mais les miles avaient tendance a rapporter
des proies plus grosses et la frtquence 

de leurs visites au nid ttait plus grande. La litttrature disponible
sur le partage des tfiches parentales 

chez les oiseaux de rivage, 5 espkces de gkolands, 6 espkces de sternes

indique que les femelles accomplissent la plupart des tiches relikes

gotlands et chez les sternes, alors que les miles se chargent surtout
de la surveillance du territoire et 

ont plus de comportements agonistiques (gotlands) et voient plus a

Ces comportements sont compatibles qualitativement avec l'hypothkse
selon laquelle les diffkrences de

du dimorphisme sexuel 

selon la taille qui prkvaut chez les goklands, mais pas chez les sternes.

abstract = {One of the crucial points of life history theory in long-lived animals is to determine the characteristics of individuals that contribute disproportionately to the next generations, as they are a major force driving demographic trends. Using little penguins (Eudyptula minor) as a model, we investigated whether individuals of a pair provided equal parental investment when raising offspring and whether their behavior was consistent over 8 years of contrasting resource availability (as inferred by breeding success). Using an automated identification system, we found that 72\% of little penguin pairs exhibited unforced (i.e. that did not result from desertions of one parent) unequal partnership along the post-guard stage. This proportion decreased in years of high breeding success. If being an equal pair appeared to be a better strategy, it was nonetheless the least observed, probably because of unsustainable costs for one of the two partners. Individuals displaying a lower investment (negative parents) in raising chicks than their partner (positive parents) were not less experienced and neither did gender explain differences between partners. Further, positive or negative parents tended to remain so in subsequent years. We suggest that the reason for an unequal investment during breeding may result from individual’s intrinsic quality.},

abstract = {All previous studies of the breeding cycle of king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus have been based on the use of flipper bands. Although time consuming, this method has been the only practical way to study penguins but has induced some substantial bias. Moreover, few data were ever collected outside the summer period and winter activities of penguins remain poorly known. We present here the first study of the king penguin breeding cycle based on the automatic monitoring of unbanded birds. This new approach allows penguins to be fol- lowed throughout their annual cycle without disturbance and detects each time they come ashore or leave the colony. Fifty birds were studied from March 1998 to March 2001. Forty other birds (20 males and 20 females) were followed during the 1999/2000 season, during which they managed to fledge a chick. These birds provide the first data on the winter activi- ties of non-breeding and unsuccessfully breeding birds. King penguins, contrary to other spe- cies of penguins and seabirds, come ashore several times during winter even if they have fai- led or not attempted to breed. Our data on the winter cycle of successful birds differ from pre- vious data and show that all chicks were fed several times during winter. Parental investment was no different between males and females in terms of the time devoted to the chick and number of feeds. Key words: king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, breeding cycle, automatic identification, Crozet Islands.},

abstract = {Le compromis entre la reproduction en cours et les chances de survivre et de se reproduire ult\'{e}rieurement est un \'{e}l\'{e}ment clef des \'{e}tudes sur l’\'{e}volution des traits d’histoire de vie. Ce travail de doctorat relatif au Manchot royal (Aptenodytes patagonicus) a pour but de tester l’existence d’un co\^{u}t de la reproduction et de d\'{e}terminer si cet oiseau long\'{e}vif se comporte comme un parent prudent face \`{a} la variabilit\'{e} environnementale. Les strat\'{e}gies individuelles varient cependant au sein d’une population, cette diversit\'{e} \'{e}tant li\'{e}e \`{a} la qualit\'{e} h\'{e}t\'{e}rog\`{e}ne des individus, mais aussi \`{a} l’h\'{e}t\'{e}rog\'{e}n\'{e}it\'{e} spatiale et/ou temporelle des conditions environnementales. Cette \'{e}tude se base sur le suivi d’oiseaux non-bagu\'{e}s, \`{a} partir d’un nouveau syst\`{e}me d’identification automatique, ANTAVIA. Les fortes probabilit\'{e}s de survie des individus reproducteurs en succ\`{e}s et reproducteurs tardifs supportent l’hypoth\`{e}se d’une h\'{e}t\'{e}rog\'{e}n\'{e}it\'{e} de la qualit\'{e} individuelle. Les individus de meilleure qualit\'{e} seraient capables de faire face \`{a} des mauvaises conditions environnementales sans mettre en p\'{e}ril leur survie, mais prendraient occasionnellement une ann\'{e}e sabbatique afin d’optimiser leur valeur reproductive r\'{e}siduelle (strat\'{e}gie du parent prudent). Nous avons d\'{e}montr\'{e} que tenter une reproduction tardive pour ces individus n’est pas plus co\^{u}teux en termes de survie que de ne pas se reproduire. Les adultes de meilleure qualit\'{e} (en termes de valeur s\'{e}lective) ne s'installent pas dans les zones centrales de la colonie consid\'{e}r\'{e}es comme potentiellement meilleures. La qualit\'{e} d’un habitat ne se limiterait donc pas aux risques de pr\'{e}dation et d’atteinte parasitaire. Le comportement agonistique des cong\'{e}n\`{e}res pourrait \^{e}tre un facteur d\'{e}terminant. Les composantes fondamentales de la valeur s\'{e}lective (survie et succ\`{e}s reproducteur) de cette esp\`{e}ce sont li\'{e}es \`{a} des processus oc\'{e}anographiques distincts. Les conditions environnementales (indice de la disponibilit\'{e} alimentaire) autour de Crozet affectent le succ\`{e}s reproducteur en cours, alors que celles rencontr\'{e}es au niveau de la zone marginale des glaces ont un impact sur la survie adulte, visible deux ans apr\`{e}s une anomalie de temp\'{e}ratures. Enfin, cette \'{e}tude montre un effet de l’\^{a}ge sur la survie, celle-ci \'{e}tant particuli\`{e}rement faible et variable (effet cohorte) lors du premier hiver en mer. Ceci soutient l’hypoth\`{e}se de l’h\'{e}t\'{e}rog\'{e}n\'{e}it\'{e} individuelle qui postule que les individus de mauvaise qualit\'{e} vont dispara\^{\i}tre de la population plus t\^{o}t que ceux de meilleure qualit\'{e}. La diminution des taux de recapture et de survie entre 4 et 5 ans semble \^{e}tre li\'{e}e aux co\^{u}ts de la premi\`{e}re tentative de reproduction. La masse au d\'{e}part en mer affecte la survie, un surpoids constituant un handicap. Enfin, les caract\`{e}res sexuels secondaires indiquent le niveau de maturit\'{e} des individus. Ce travail de doctorat nous a permis d’\'{e}valuer les compromis adaptatifs qui ont contribu\'{e} \`{a} l'\'{e}mergence de strat\'{e}gies d’histoire de vie chez cet oiseau marin long\'{e}vif.},

abstract = {The distribution and behaviour of foraging seabirds depend on the physical features of the ocean at different time and space scales, but little is known for penguins. We investigated the for- aging behaviour of king penguins in relation to oceanographic features over the birds’ complete annual cycle. A total of 44 birds was followed between 1994 and 1997 at the Crozet Islands to moni- tor foraging habitat, diving behaviour, and sea temperature of the water column, using satellite- tracking and time-temperature-depth recorders (TDR) carried by the birds. The study included breeding in summer, the winter period of chick raising, and the post-moult period in spring. King penguins foraged in 2 specific regions in response to the seasonal changes in local prey availability. In summer, satellite-tracked birds during the incubating and brooding stages (n = 14) preferentially exploited the polar front located 340 to 450 km to the south of their breeding site. TDR-equipped birds (n = 12) also foraged at the polar front in summer as indicated by the vertical temperature pro- files. In autumn and winter, satellite tracks (n = 8) and sea temperature measurements of TDR- equipped birds (n = 8) showed that birds with cr\`{e}ching chicks instead foraged in antarctic waters, with 70\% of individuals reaching the latitude of the pack-ice limit (1600 km from the colony). This suggests better prey availability than in the polar frontal zone at that time. When the birds were at the latitude of the polar front, the thickness of the surface mixed layer (SML) ranged from 80 m in summer to 140 m in winter, the SML temperature was \~{}4°C and the thermocline had a mean maxi- mum gradient of –0.5°C for each 10 m depth. When the birds were at their most southerly position, the depth of the SML ranged from 100 m in autumn to \~{}150 m in winter, while its temperature ranged from –0.8 to 2°C. The temperature gradient of the thermocline showed an inversion in autumn, and this gradient was positive in winter (mean maximum gradient of 0.3°C for each 10 m depth). Except for spring birds (n = 4) and for 1 winter bird, where the SML exceeded the diving range, all TDR- equipped penguins (n = 19) dived preferentially in and below the depth of the thermocline, thereby minimising diving in the SML. Therefore, their prey may have been predictably concentrated below the SML through oceanographic processes. In king penguins, the strategy of going south could then have evolved in relation to the thinning of the SML towards the south at any time of the year.},

abstract = {L’envol du jeune oiseau est une transition de vie vers l’autonomie locomotrice et alimentaire. L’\'{e}tat physique, et notamment les capacit\'{e}s locomotrices et l’\'{e}tat \'{e}nerg\'{e}tique, doivent alors \^{e}tre optimis\'{e}s pour limiter les risques accrus de mortalit\'{e} par pr\'{e}dation ou par famine sur individu inexp\'{e}riment\'{e}. Cet \'{e}tat physique est largement d\'{e}pendant de l’investissement parental, lequel est au c\oe ur de plusieurs conflits \'{e}volutionnistes: parent-petit, sexuel et intra-fratrie. Mon travail de th\`{e}se s’attache \`{a} comprendre, dans le contexte des conflits familiaux, les m\'{e}canismes proximaux retenus chez l’oiseau pour optimiser le ph\'{e}notype \`{a} l’envol. Il utilise une approche comparative entre deux esp\`{e}ces \`{a} soins bi-parentaux et \`{a} l’\'{e}cologie contrast\'{e}e : le Manchot royal (MR ; Aptenodytes patagonicus ; nich\'{e}e simple), oiseau marin \`{a} distribution oc\'{e}anique et sub-antarctique et la Cigogne blanche (CB ; Ciconia ciconia ; nich\'{e}e multiple), oiseau terrestre de la zone temp\'{e}r\'{e}e. Mes r\'{e}sultats montrent que conform\'{e}ment aux pr\'{e}dictions du conflit parent-petit, l’approvisionnement alimentaire parental est arr\^{e}t\'{e} (MR) ou r\'{e}duit (CB) dans les semaines qui pr\'{e}c\`{e}dent l’envol alors que la croissance du poussin n’est pas termin\'{e}e. Chez le MR, l’accumulation de r\'{e}serves lipidiques dans la prog\'{e}niture permet \`{a} l’\'{e}leveur de d\'{e}serter et d’initier la mue pr\'{e}nuptiale tout en assurant la fin de la croissance du poussin \`{a} jeun, et notamment celle d’un plumage imperm\'{e}able et n\'{e}cessaire \`{a} la survie en eaux froides. De plus, les r\'{e}serves accumul\'{e}es dans le poussin d\'{e}sert\'{e} pr\'{e}viennent une activation de l’axe hypothalamo-hypophyso-corticosurr\'{e}nalien (HHCS) et un catabolisme exacerb\'{e} des prot\'{e}ines, lequel menacerait l’int\'{e}grit\'{e} musculaire et l’efficacit\'{e} locomotrice en mer. Enfin, l’ajustement de l’investissement paternel aux besoins nutritionnels du poussin permettrait la d\'{e}sertion pr\'{e}coce du parent femelle et par l\`{a} la stabilisation du conflit sexuel. Chez la CB, la restriction alimentaire parentale induit chez les cigogneaux une balance \'{e}nerg\'{e}tique n\'{e}gative et un stress nutritionnel qui active l’axe HHCS et la s\'{e}cr\'{e}tion de corticost\'{e}rone. Les niveaux \'{e}lev\'{e}s de corticost\'{e}rone plasmatique stimuleraient les exercices locomoteurs au nid et par l\`{a} faciliteraient l’envol. La r\'{e}cession de masse qui pr\'{e}c\`{e}de l’envol est plus marqu\'{e}e chez les derniers \'{e}clos de par leur d\'{e}savantage comp\'{e}titif et leur moindre acc\`{e}s \`{a} la nourriture apport\'{e}e par les parents. Le rang d’\'{e}closion et la hi\'{e}rarchie de d\'{e}veloppement au sein de la nich\'{e}e moduleraient la sensibilit\'{e} de l’axe HHCS au stress nutritionnel, ce qui pr\'{e}viendrait les effets d\'{e}l\'{e}t\`{e}res d’une corticost\'{e}ron\'{e}mie chroniquement \'{e}lev\'{e}e sur la croissance alaire des derniers \'{e}clos. Les r\'{e}sultats de ma th\`{e}se permettent de proposer de nouvelles hypoth\`{e}ses quant aux pressions s\'{e}lectives exerc\'{e}es sur l’accumulation des r\'{e}serves lipidiques d’une part et la s\'{e}cr\'{e}tion de corticost\'{e}rone d’autre part chez le poussin d’oiseau en fin de croissance.},

abstract = {Changes in seabird populations, and particularly of penguins, offer a unique opportunity for investigating the impact of fisheries and climatic variations on marine resources. Such investigations often require large-scale banding to identify individual birds, but the significance of the data relies on the assumption that no bias is introduced in this type of long-term monitoring. After 5 years of using an automated system of identification of king penguins implanted with electronic tags (100 adult king penguins were implanted with a transponder tag, 50 of which were also flipper banded), we can report that banding results in later arrival at the colony for courtship in some years, lower breeding probability and lower chick production. We also found that the survival rate of unbanded, electronically tagged king penguin chicks after 2-3 years is approximately twice as large as that reported in the literature for banded chicks.},

abstract = {We examined the growth rate of the breeding population of king penguins of Crozet archipelago over 41 years. Most colonies showed positive growth rates from the 1960s. However, there was evidence for a decrease in the larger colonies since the early 1990s, and for lower growth rates in the smaller colonies during the 1990s. The overall population size was estimated using log linear models, and the average annual growth rate was +6.3\% for the 41-year period. Four change points were detected in the annual growth rate: +21.1\% during 1978–1985, +4.3\% during 1985–1995, 19.2\% during 1995–1999, and+10.9\% during 1999–2003. Time-series analyses of the population-size estimates and the rela- tionship between growth rate and population size both indicated density-dependence in population growth rate. Variations in population sizes are also discussed in relation to environmental fluctuations. Our results sug- gest that important changes occurred over the past 10 years.},

@article{Bried1999,
abstract = {In long-lived birds, monogamy is thought to enable breeders to retain the same mate from year to year, but exceptions occur. For example, King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) and Emperor Penguins (A. forsteri) have much lower mate fidelity than do smaller species of penguins, despite their high rates of survival. Recently, Olsson (1998) suggested that divorce in King Penguins could be adaptive. Although Olsson was the first to propose an adaptive function for divorce in this species, he was unable to assess the relationships among individual quality, date of arrival, mate choice, and breeding success. Accordingly, we studied King Penguins and Emperor Penguins to further examine the determinants and consequences of divorce. Mate retention was not affected by breeding performance in the previous year or by experience, and neither mate retention nor divorce had significant consequences on chick production the following year. King Penguins were more likely to divorce as arrival asynchrony of previous partners increased. In Emperor Penguins, this tendency to divorce occurred only when females returned earlier than their previous mates. Most Emperor Penguin pairs formed within 24 hours after the arrival of males, which were outnumbered by females. King Penguins that had nested successfully in their next to last attempt were favored as mates for ones that had been unsuccessful, and individuals of both species probably chose the best mates available. Most of our results for King Penguins and Emperor Penguins supported Olsson's (1998) conclusions in that divorce appears to be adaptive. Mate retention in the absence of a true nesting site (neither species builds a nest) would be maladaptive for these species, which face strong time constraints for breeding. Therefore, divorce occurs because costs of mate retention are high. Aptenodytes penguins appear to have adopted an optimal divorce strategy in order to adapt to their long breeding cycle in a demanding environment.},

@article{CluttonBrock1992,
abstract = {In most animals, members of one sex compete more intensely for mates than members of the other sex, and show a greater development of secondary sexual traits. The relative intensity of mating competition in the two sexes depends on the operational sex ratio (OSR) (the ratio of males that are ready to mate to females that are ready to mate) at the site and times when mating occurs. The extent and direction of biases in the OSR is closely related to the potential rates of reproduction that individual males and females can achieve, although the distribution of the two sexes in space and time, sex differences in development time or life expectancy, and biases in the sex ratio at birth or hatching can also be important. The potential rates of reproduction in the two sexes are, in turn, affected by the proportion of time and energy expended by male and female parents on their progeny, though other factors may constrain reproductive rate in one or both sexes. We outline a simple model of the factors affecting the OSR, where relative parental expenditure by the two sexes and the adult sex ratio are fixed, and a more complex model where the adult sex ratio varies in relation to the reproductive activity of the two sexes. This framework for relating sex differences in mating competition to the OSR, potential reproductive rates, and parental expenditure differs from Triver's concept of the relation between parental investment and mating competition in three ways: first, it identifies the OSR as the immediate factor determining which sex completes most intensely for mates; second, it recognizes that factors other than the future fitness costs of rearing offspring can affect the potential reproductive rate of the two sexes; third, it suggests an empirical measure (potential reproductive rate) that can be estimated in natural populations and used to predict the distribution of mating competition.},

Why do only females care for eggs and young in some animals, only males in others, and both parents in a few? To what extent is parental care adjusted to variation in its benefits to offspring and its costs to parents? How do parents divide their resources between their sons and daughters? In this book separate chapters examine the evolution of variation in egg and neonate size, of viviparity and other forms of bearing, and of differences in the duration of incubation, gestation, and lactation. The book reviews theoretical and empirical predictions concerning the evolution of parental care and examines the extent to which these are supported by empirical evidence. The author examines the distribution of parental care among offspring, reviews the empirical evidence that parents invest to different extents in their sons and daughters, and discusses the degree to which parents manipulate the sex ratio of their progeny in relation to the availability of resources.},

@article{Parker1996,
abstract = {We outline a technique for deducing the general direction of sexual competition which does not involve direct measurement of operational sex ratio. In doing so, we identify three key parameters that are responsible for the control of sexual selection; the relative `times out' from reproductive activity for each sex, the adult sex ratio, and the extent of collateral investment. Reproductive events can be complex, involving collateral investments from several individuals, either simultaneously or sequentially. For example, two males may invest in the clutch of a single female. The direction of sexual competition depends on all three components. If the adult sex ratio is unity, it is easy to see that techniques involving comparison of potential rates of reproduction give the same prediction of the direction of sexual competition as times out, basically because potential reproductive rate involves the use of times out. Increased collateral investment by one sex increases the probability of sexual competition among the opposite sex. We stress that it is important to use the population mean values for relative times out and not the maximum possible value for an individual because it is the availability of mates within the population that will determine whether an individual will compete.},

@article{Barta2002,
abstract = {Parental care often increases the survival of offspring, but it is costly to parents. Because of this trade-off, a sexual conflict over care arises. The solution to this conflict depends on the interactions between the male and female parents, the behavior of other animals in the population, and the individual differences within a sex. We take an integrated approach and develop a state-dependent dynamic game model of parental care. The model investigates a single breeding season in which the animals can breed several times. Each parent's decision about whether to care for the brood or desert depends on its own energy reserves, its mate's reserves, and the time in the season. We develop a fully consistent solution in which the behavior of an animal is the best given the behavior of its mate and of all other animals in the population. The model predicts that females may strategically reduce their own reserves so as to "force" their mate to provide care. We investigate how the energy costs of caring and searching for a mate, values of care (how the probability of offspring survival depends on the pattern of care), and population sex ratio influence the pattern of care over the breeding season.},

abstract = {There was a seasonal biomodality in the distribution of breeding activities of King Penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus, studied from 1991 to 1994 at South Georgia, with peaks of courtship and egg-laying 2-3 months apart. The late peak was of birds that bred successfully the previous year, whereas the early peak was of birds that had failed. Successful birds were delayed because the median time for a complete breeding cycle, including moult, was \&gt; 14 month. Although most birds made a breeding attempt each year, none bred successfully in two consecutive seasons. Hence, in practice the cycle was biennial. The egg-laying period spanned four months but only pairs that laid within the first quarter of this period were successful. Parental quality, rather than laying date, strongly influenced the outcome of first quarter breeding attempts. No late breeding attempt was successful and why they are undertaken is unclear. At least they posed no measurable cost, either by delaying subsequent breeding or by increasing mortality; this may be important for balancing the low benefit. After the over-wintering fast the chick could be fledged by a single parent; but no sex-specific difference in invested time in the chick near to fledge was observed.},

abstract = {Evolutionary game theory is concerned with the evolutionarily stable outcomes of the process of natural selection. The theory is especially relevant when the fitness of an organism depends on the behaviour of other members of its population. Here we focus on the interaction between two organisms that have a conflict of interest. The standard approach to such two-player games is to assume that each player chooses a single action and that the evolutionarily stable action of each player is the best given the action of its opponent. We argue that, instead, most two-player games should be modelled as involving a series of interactions in which opponents negotiate the final outcome. Thus we should be concerned with evolutionarily stable negotiation rules rather than evolutionarily stable actions. The evolutionarily stable negotiation rule of each player is the best rule given the rule of its opponent. As we show, the action chosen as a result of the negotiation is not the best action given the action of the opponent. This conclusion necessitates a fundamental change in the way that evolutionary games are modelled.},

abstract = {Paternity has been hypothesized to be related to the evolution of paternal care because (1) there should be selection for males not to invest in broods with an uncertain parentage, or (2) male extrapair activity is traded against paternal care. We used interspecific comparisons to discriminate between these alternatives. Male participation in three kinds of parental care (nest building, incubation, provisioning of offspring) increased with high paternity in their own nests. Male parental activities at some stages of the breeding cycle were significantly correlated. A multivariate analysis taking this intercorrelation between different components of care and potentially confounding variables such as precociality, polyandry, and sexual dichromatism into account revealed that paternity was significantly positively related to offspring provisioning, while male participation in the other com- ponents of parental care did not explain a significant amount of interspecific variation in paternity. Analyses of evolutionary transitions between different dichotomized states of paternity and paternal care provided no clear conclusions concerning evolutionary scenarios. However, theoretical arguments and the results of the contrast analyses suggest that male provisioning of offspring evolved in response to paternity. Key words: extrapair paternity, incubation, parental effort, provisioning, sexual selection. [Behav Ecol 11:472–485 (2000)]},

abstract = {(1) From 1966 to 1968, 14 395 herring gulls of known date of hatching were ringed on the Isle of May, Scotland, from a colony whose breeding season had been extended in 1967-68 by large scale egg removal followed by re-laying. Post-fledging survival in relation to date of hatching was analysed, not only by examining first winter recoveries, but also by studying large numbers of ringed birds that were culled between 1972 and 1975 when they returned to the island to breed. (2) There was no major difference in the proportions of young recovered up to 31 December in the year of hatching according to hatching date, although fewer recoveries of very late hatched young were reported. This result was not verified by the much larger sample of recoveries provided by the culls. (3) The proportions of young that survived to be culled showed that in the 1966 year class, only young hatching after 29 June survived less well than the remainder. This group represented only 3\% of the total sample. In the following year class, there was no relationship between hatching date and post-fledging survival, even amongst abnormally late hatching chicks from repeat clutches. However, post-fledging mortality of 1968 young appeared to be twice as high as in the previous two year classes, and the proportion recovered in the culls was inversely correlated with date of hatching. This indicated a progressively increased post-fledging mortality with lateness of hatching. (4) In 1968, but not in the previous two years, juveniles from broods of three fledged chicks survived less well than those from smaller broods. For those hatching later in the season, even juveniles from broods of two appeared to be at a disadvantage compared with those from broods of one. (5) Various reasons for the relationship between date of hatching and post-fledging survival are discussed.},

abstract = {Inter-individual differences in fitness in female vertebrates have often been related to phenotypic discrepancies, suggesting that bigger individuals exhibit greater fitness. However, the use of the temporally variable indices of quality, such as body mass/condition, may not represent the most reliable index over longer time intervals. Few studies have assessed the direct influence of body size (BS) on individual fitness. We addressed this knowledge gap using data from long-term monitoring of individually marked female subantarctic fur seals. The females of higher quality (i.e. higher lifetime reproductive success) were larger in BS than their counterparts, which correlated with their ability to provision their pup with greater and more regular energy supply, possibly through the maximization of foraging performance and body fat storage. We accordingly found that our study population could be divided into three contrasted categories of maternal quality, with 33\% of the females producing over 71\% of the viable offspring constituting the next generation. We suggest that a larger BS represents a crucial selective advantage for a central place forager, especially when exploiting remotely available resources.},

abstract = {1. We examined survival and recruitment (into the breeding population) in three cohorts of western gulls Larus occidentalis (Audubon) in relation to brood size at hatching, hatching order and hatching date. We divided the pre-breeding period into four stages: (i) the natal stage--`pre-fledging' from hatching to independence; (ii) the juvenile stage--the period from independence to age 1 year; (iii) the subadult stage--the second and third years of life; and (iv) the recruitment stage--the period when adults breed for the first time. 2. Hatching date and hatching order (in order of importance) each had a strong, negative effect on survival in the natal stage. Brood size had little effect on natal survival; however, after controlling for hatching date there was a significant negative effect. Juvenile survival covaried positively with brood size, negatively with hatching date, and negatively (but weakly) with hatching order. No variate correlated with survival in the subadult stage; however, recruitment probability of adults covaried negatively with hatching date. Effects of each variate did not reflect confounding by parental age. 3. Of the three variables, only the effect of hatching date varied between cohorts, and only in the natal stage. 4. The post-fledging survival advantage of hatching early in the season (expressed in the juvenile and recruitment stages) may reflect a direct effect; chicks fledging early in the season may establish lasting dominance over other chicks, and/or an indirect effect (better parental quality). We suggest that the post-fledging advantage of hatching into a large brood probably reflects a direct effect; competitive abilities may covary positively with brood size due to interaction between siblings, and/or an indirect effect (parental quality). 5. Relative recruitment rate of different cohorts was accurately predicted by natal survival. However, natal survival was a poor indicator of the probability that a given hatching recruited because of selection occurring post-fledging on differences related to brood size and to a lesser extent on hatching order and hatching date. As a result, each parent's reproductive success was poorly measured by natal survival of their young. The data suggest that survival of young to age 1 year provides a more reliable estimate of recruitment probability and a parent's reproductive success.},

abstract = {Captive King Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonica) chicks can fast for 5 months during the subantarctic winter with a 70\% decrease in body mass. To investigate the adaptive value of this remarkable resistance to starvation, we compared captive chicks with free-ranging chicks in their colony at Possession Island, Crozet Archipelago. The chicks in the colony, from mid-April to beginning of September (i.e. all winter) were fed only every 39 days by their parents; some were not fed at all. In spring (October-December) the surviving chicks were fed every 6 days, and their growth was completed. Overall chick mortality in the colony during the winter and subsequent spring was about 50\%. Mortality was highest in October, 6 months after the beginning of the winter, and may be attributed mainly to starvation. The decrease in body mass in the free-ranging chicks was remarkably similar to that for captive birds. In both groups, three periods were characterized according to the observed changes in the daily decrease in body mass per unit body mass (dm/mdt): dm/mdt dropped during the first period (I) of 5-6 days, was minimum and steady during period II, which lasted about 4 months, and increased in period III. Blood analysis of the captive chicks indicated the three periods correspond to modifications in protein breakdown. An initial decrease in uricacidemia indicates period I is a short period of transition, marked by a decrease in protein breakdown. In period II a minimum and constant uricacidemia, in parallel with a progressive increase in ketonemia, indicates efficient protein sparing while most of the energy is derived from lipids. Period III is critical because, from a rise in uricacidemia concomitant with a decreasing ketonemia, proteins are no longer spared. The extreme resistance of King Penguin chicks to starvation in winter may be explained partly by the ability to spare proteins for several months (period II). It occurs at a growth stage when the parents' feeding visits are rare. Other laboratory and field investigations of birds suggest that the means by which a wide variety of domestic and wild species adapt to fasting also may be interpreted in terms of three periods corresponding to changes in protein breakdown.},

abstract = {Sex ratio theory predicts that, if prevailing ecological or social circumstances differentially influence the fitness benefits of offspring of each sex, parents should adjust their production accordingly to maximize fitness. For species in which sex is chromosomally determined, such as birds and mammals, a differential effect of maternal condition on the fitness of male and female young is one important route whereby selection is expected to favor a bias in the offspring sex ratio at birth or egg laying. However, despite its central place in sex allocation theory, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in wild populations. We manipulated maternal condition upward and downward in a sexually dimorphic wild bird and examined the effect on offspring survival and on offspring sex ratio. The survival to fledging of male, but not female, young was substantially reduced if they came from less well provisioned eggs produced by females in relatively poor condition. As female condition, and thereby her capacity to produce high quality eggs, declined, she progressively skewed the sex ratio of her eggs toward females; i.e., she produced more of the sex with the higher survival prospects. The decline in the survival of male offspring, and the sex ratio bias, was removed when maternal condition was enhanced. These results provide experimental evidence of an adaptive, facultative adjustment of sex ratio in response to changes in maternal condition in wild birds.},

abstract = {The evolution of family life has traditionally been studied in parallel by behavioral ecologists and quantitative geneticists. The former focus on parent-offspring conflict and whether parents or offspring control provisioning, whereas the latter concentrate on the coadaptation of parental supply and offspring demand. Here we show how prenatal effects on offspring begging can link the two different approaches. Using theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that when offspring control provisioning, prenatal effects primarily serve the parent's interests: Selection on parents drives coadaptation of parent and offspring traits. In contrast, when parents control provisioning, prenatal effects primarily serve the offspring's interests: Selection on the offspring drives coadaptation of parent and offspring traits. Parent-offspring conflict may thus be responsible for the selective forces that generate parent-offspring coadaptation.},
